data(iris)


# Analysis ----------------------------------------------------------------
## Try to answer each of the following questions:

## 1. Find all rows from the "versicolor" species that have a Petal more than 4 times longer than it is wide.

## 1b. Find all rows from the "versicolor" species that have a Petal length less than 3 times its width.


## 2. What is the longest Petal in each species?


## 3. Which species has the largest Length to Width ratio for Sepals?


## 4. Are there any rows with a Sepal Length more than 2 standard deviations away from the mean?
## Tip: you might want to use functions like sd() (standard deviation) and abs() (absolute value)


## 5 (bonus). Find all rows from the "virginica" species 
##            that have wider Petals than any of the other species
