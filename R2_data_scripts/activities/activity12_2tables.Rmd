# Load Data

Add code to the chunk below to read the files from the previous activity ("`activity11_write.R`").

*Run it when you are ready or want to test it, then move on to the next section.*

```{r load data}

```

# Do Things

Now combine them back into a single table.

```

Try combining the data.frames in both dimensions (by row and by column) to compare the results.

```{r}
