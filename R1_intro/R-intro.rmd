## Learning Objectives

* Get familiar with the ![]( `r file.path(R.home("doc"), "html", "logo.jpg")`){height=1em} *interface*
* Use technical _terms_ for $\R$ concepts
* Enter *commands*
  * use $\R$ interactively: understand input & output
  * use some common *functions*
* Get familiar with '$\R$ objects'
  * store & retrieve values
* Understand *Errors*, *Warnings*, and *Messages*
* How to get Help


## Why is it named '$\R$'?

1. **$\R$** started as an _open-source_ implementation of the  
   **`S`** statistical computing language (S-PLUS)^[https://www.r-project.org/about.html]
  
   - `S` was created at Bell Laboratories in 1976^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language)]
   
   - $\R$ was based on the `S` syntax (mostly v3), but works very differently "under the hood".
  
2. **$\R$** was created by [**R**]{.underline}oss Ihaka and [**R**]{.underline}obert Gentleman 
   --- aka "R & R"^[https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html] --- 
   at the University of Aukland in the early 1990s.

\
_Read more about the history of $\R$  on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#History)_^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#History]


# Interacting with $\R$ (Interface)

## The $\Rlogo$ Interface

- 'base $\R$' has a slightly different interface for each **O**perating **S**ystem (OS)
  - GUI = **G**raphical **U**ser **I**nterface
- $\R$ can also run inside of a terminal (no GUI) or other software (different GUI).

### [**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) (IDE)

- An IDE is like an extra interface layer on top of 'base $\R$'
- IDEs often add convenient tools to make writing code easier (e.g., syntax highlighting),
  and for developing larger projects with multiple files.
- **[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)** is one of the most popular cross-platform IDEs for $\R$.
  - RStudio is available in open source (free/libre) and commercial^[for organizations not able to use software licensed with AGPL] editions.

## Interacting with $\Rlogo$

- Regardless of the GUI, 
  you interact with $\R$ primarily using a _command\ line_
  
  - aka a [c]{.underline}ommand [l]{.underline}ine [i]{.underline}nterface (cli)
  - the command line is usually in the *console*

- “Question-and-Answer Model”

  - | You ask $\R$ to do something (a *command*),  
    |      and $\R$ tells you the answer (*result*).
    
- Instructions are given to $\R$ using the *R language*.

::: notes
R is designed so that users can start by using it *interactively* (what we will do today), and then gradually use it for more programming as their needs and skills grow.

  - Not "point-and-click": no menus or wizards to guide you through steps of an analysis or procedure.
:::

  
## The $\Rlogo$ console

The *console* is a window or pane where you will find:

- The _command line_

  - where you will enter commands for $\R$ to run

- Results of commands and other output

- `Messages`, \WarningTok{Warnings}, and \ErrorTok{Errors} 


## The $\Rlogo$ command-line

- The command *prompt* normally looks like this:

  ``` default
  >
  ```
  
  \annote{(the colour varies depending on the interface)}
  
  - This is $\R$'s way of saying "I am ready to accept new commands".
  - Type a new command on the line after this prompt (i.e., *input*).
  
- **Press \important{\texttt{return}}/\important{\texttt{enter}} to *run* the current *command* **

- If you can still edit the command next to the prompt, then it has not been submitted to $\R$ to execute (it is still waiting for input).

- If the last prompt is not empty (i.e., there is text beside it)  
  _and_ you cannot edit what is beside the prompt,  
  it means $\R$ is still running the last command and is not ready to accept a new command yet.
  
  - Wait for a new empty prompt to appear before entering the next command.


## The $\Rlogo$ command-line (continued)

- If the prompt looks like this:  

  ``` default
  +
  ```

  it means the last command was _incomplete_ and $\R$ is waiting for more input.  
  $\R$ will not do anything until the command is completed or cancelled.
  
  - This usually means you forgot a closing\
    *quote* \important{\texttt{"}}, *parenthesis* \important{\texttt{(}}, 
    *bracket* \important{\texttt{[}}, or *brace* \important{\texttt{\{}}
    
- \highlight{You can \textit{cancel} the current command at any time by pressing \texttt{escape}} (\important{\texttt{esc}})


# Warming up: some early commands

## Input & Output

In this presentation, 

+ *commands* that can be entered in the *command-line* look like this:

  ``` default{#format_input}
  Input (commands)
  ```

  - You can try these yourself!

+ Expected output (results) look like this:

  ```{r format_output, include=TRUE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
  cat("Output (results)")
  ```


## $\Rlogo$ offers suggestions

- These are *expressions*
- *Expressions* are *evaluated*, and the *value* (result) is *returned* 
  (sometimes\ *invisibly*)

::: notes

The bullet points are accurate, but I note that the 
[R Language Definition](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html)
distinguishes between 'expressions', which are actually a type of object,
and 'statements' (see s2.1.3 'Language objects', s2.1.4 'Expression objects'):

- An *expression* \[object?\] contains one or more statements.
- A statement is a syntactically correct collection of tokens.
- Expression objects are special language objects which contain parsed but unevaluated R statements. 
- "an expression object can contain several such expressions" (not clear)

Therefore, my understanding is that 
a *statement* is parsed (by the R parser),
which results in an unevaluated *expression* (an object of mode "expression"),
which can in turn be evaluated (by 'the evaluator', such as `eval()`)
to return the *value*.

"All expressions have a value." (s3 'Evaluation of expressions')

:::


## $\Rlogo$ command-line tips

- With the cursor next to the empty prompt (\OtherTok{\texttt{>}}),  
  use the up & down \important{arrow keys} (&uarr;&darr;) 
  to re-produce previous commands.
  
- This lets you “scroll through your *command history*”.
  
- Press \important{up} (\important{$\uparrow$}) once, and you get the last command you entered  
  without having to copy & paste.


# Simple $\R$ objects

## Vectors

- The most basic kind of *object* in $\R$ is a *vector*

- Think of a vector as a list of related values (data),  
  which are _all the same type_
  
- A single value is an "*atomic vector*" (a vector with a length of 1)

<!-- empty paragraph for space -->\

\end{tikzpicture}


## Vectors

- Vectors can be used in calculations

- Operations are applied to each item
  (*element-wise*)
  
  ```{r vectors_1, results='hide'}
  sum( c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) )
  1:10 + 2
  1:5 * 5:1
  ```
- Vectors can be used to plot data in a graph

  ```{r vectors_2, results='hide', fig.keep='none'}
  plot( rnorm(1000) )
  hist( rnorm(1000) )
  ```
  
<!-- 1,000 random numbers from a normal distribution -->

\end{tikzpicture}


# Storing & retrieving values

## Symbolic _variables_
<!-- variables vs objects?  Objects vs names?  
In R, everything is an _object_, and each has a name -->

- You can store values (*objects*) in symbolic variables (*names*) 
  using an *assignment operator*:
  
-------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
`<-`{.r} assign the *value* on the **right** to the *name* on the **left**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

:::::: {.columns .onlytextwidth}
::: {.column width="48%"}

- Names can include:

|||<!-- empty header row, because most Markdown parsers require a header row -->
|:----------|---------|
|letters    |\StringTok{\texttt{a-z A-Z}}|
|numbers    |\StringTok{\texttt{0-9}}    |
|periods    |\StringTok{\texttt{.}}      |
|underscores|\StringTok{\texttt{\_}}     |

- Names _should begin with a **\StringTok{letter}**_.

:::

```{r assignment, results='hide'}

B <- 10 * 10
A_log <- log(A)

## Retrieve values

When a variable *name* is evaluated, it returns the stored *value*. 

:::::: {.columns .onlytextwidth}
::: {.column width="45%"}

```{r}
A
A_log
```

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

```{r}
B
x
```

:::
::::::

```{r}
B.seq
```


## Built-in variables

Some words and letters already have values in $\R$  
and should **never be used as variable names**.

:::::: {.columns .onlytextwidth}
::: {.column width="45%"}

```{r}
pi
```

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
version
```
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("... information about \nthis version of R ...")
```

:::
::::::

```{r}
letters
LETTERS
```


## Reserved words

Some words and letters already have special meaning in the R language (*keywords*) 
and should **never be used as variable names**.
