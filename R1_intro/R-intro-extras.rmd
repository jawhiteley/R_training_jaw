# Matrix math

- $\R$ can do _matrix math_ --- which are uses in many statistical procedures
  - But the _syntax_ is different from the usual math operators
- Using a regular multiplication symbol (`*`) results in *element*-wise multiplication
  - each _element_ (item) in matrix1 is multiplied by the corresponding _element_ in matrix2, etc.
```{r results='hide'}
c(1, 2, 3) * c(3, 2, 1)
```
- _Matrix multiplication_ is specified by this operator: `%*%`
```{r results='hide'}
c(1, 2, 3) %*% c(3, 2, 1)
```
