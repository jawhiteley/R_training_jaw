# Get $\Rlogo$

## Check your Operating System

On **Linux**, $\R$ is often available in your _package management system_,  
and can be installed directly from there.

On **macOS**, $\R$ can be installed directly with one of:

+ [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) ([formula `r`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/r#default))
+ [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/R/)

Otherwise, you can [download](#download-r) and install $\R$ from CRAN ([next&rarr;](#download-r))


## Download $\Rlogo$ {#download-r}

1. Go to [www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org/) in your web browser

2. Click on '[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)' in the menu on left (under "**Download**")  

   - CRAN = [C]{.underline}omprehensive [R]{.underline} [A]{.underline}rchive [N]{.underline}etwork
   
3. Choose a "mirror" (server) that is close to where you are, or at an institution that you trust.  
   If you're not sure, you can use one of:
   
   - [cloud.r-project.org](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
   - [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org/)
   
4. Click on the link for your computer Operating System: Linux, macOS, or Windows
   (in the top section labelled "**Download and Install R**")

5. The next steps depend on your computer’s Operating System
   - follow the instructions on the subsequent web pages


# About [$\Rlogo$](https://www.r-project.org/)

## Why $\Rlogo$?

+ It's **fast & lean**
  - Load only the components you need at the time
+ It works on **multiple platforms**
+ It has sophisticated **graphics** capabilities
  - Produce publication-quality graphs in the same software as your
    analysis. No need for post-processing in Illustrator or Photoshop.
+ It's **flexible**, **powerful**, and **innovative**
  - Advanced methods are often available in R before other statistical software.
+ It can be used interactively, or to run pre-written *scripts*
  - Scripts provide automatic record of how an analysis was performed, 
    that can be re-produced even years later.

## $\Rlogo$ is **Free/Libre** Open Source Software (FLOSS)

* Free as in 'beer': you do not have to pay $ for it.
* Free as in 'speech': You have the _freedom_ to ...
  - use it for any purpose
  - study how it works and adapt it to your needs
  - redistribute copies to your friends & neighbours
  - improve it and release improvements publicly
  
* The source code is _open_ ("open source"[^wikipedia][^osi])
  - the source code is publicly available
  - the license allows for anyone to copy, modify, or distribute the code.
  - open collaboration is encouraged
  - anyone can propose changes and improvements, 
    but a _Core Team_ controls what changes are integrated into the versions 
    released & distributed by the [R Project](https://www.r-project.org/)

::: notes

Software licenses typically set conditions on _sharing_ the software or source code, not what you do with it. 
Many licenses allow the software to be used for commercial purposes (you can even sell it), but some require derivative works to be released under the same (public) license, which prevents their code or software from being used as part of _proprietary software_.

# Using $\Rlogo$

## $\R$ is a programming language

- $\R$ is command-driven
  - Not "point and click"
  - No menus, pop-up windows, or wizards
- $\R$ will not tell you what to do, or guide you through the steps of an analysis or method. 
  $\R$ provides no structure.
- $\R$ will do all the calculations for you, and  
  it will do _exactly what you tell it_ (not necessarily _what you want_).
- This means $\R$ has the flexibility and power to do 
  *exactly what you want, exactly how you want it done*.
- **The hard part is figuring out 
  _how to do what you want_**


## Learning $\R$

:::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

| Learning any programming language is a journey.
| 
| It always feels like there's more to learn.
| 
| 

$\R$ is designed so that users can start by using it _interactively_ (as in this workshop), 
and then gradually use it for more programming as their needs and skills grow.

<!--   - Most real statistical analysis requires some programming. -->

# Names

## Symbolic _Variables_

- You can store values (*objects*) in symbolic variables (*names*)\
  using an *assignment operator*

-------- ------------------------------------------------------------------
`->`{.r} assign the *value* on the **left** to the *name* on the **right**
`<-`{.r} assign the *value* on the **right** to the *name* on the **left**
`=`{.r}  assign the *value* on the **right** to the *name* on the **left**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- pure latex table, with custom latex formatting commands (less portable)
```{=latex}
% Latex table, because I want to use LaTeX commands to format text,
% which somehow causes extra space in the tex output, if used in a Markdown table.
\begin{longtable}[c]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule()
\endhead
\OperatorTok{\texttt{-\textgreater{}}} & assign the \emph{value} on the \textbf{left} to
the \emph{name} on the \textbf{right} \\
\OperatorTok{\texttt{\textless{}-}} & assign the \emph{value} on the \textbf{right} to
the \emph{name} on the \textbf{left} \\
\OperatorTok{\texttt{=}} & assign the \emph{value} on the \textbf{right} to
the \emph{name} on the \textbf{left} \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}
```
-->
 
- '`<-`{.r}' is preferred, because it is unambiguous\
  (to people _and_ to $\R$)
- '`=`{.r}' is not allowed in certain situations\
  (e.g., when [surrounded by other expressions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51564252))
  - '`=`{.r}' is also used to set *argument* *values* in *function calls*,\
  which is a different meaning and its most common use.

- You can also use the `assign` *function* (advanced):

```{r, results='hide'}
assign('x', 3)    # assign the value 3 to the variable ‘x’
```

## Variable / Object Names

- In $\R$, all variables are *objects*
  - In $\R$, **everything** is an *object*
  
- Object names can include:\
  (depending on the language or *locale*)

|||<!-- empty header row, because most Markdown parsers require a header row -->
|:----------|---------|
|letters    |`a-z A-Z`|
|numbers    |`0-9`    |
|periods    |`.`      |
|underscores|`_`      |

- Names _should begin with a letter_

```{r, results='hide'}
A <- 10
B = 10 * 10
log(A) -> A_log
B.seq <- 1:B
assign('x', 3)
```


## Object Names: Details

Names can start with a **letter** or a **period** _(more on this later)_

```{r, results='hide'}
myvar  <- T
.myvar <- T
```
  
but anything else triggers an \important{error}
```{r, eval=FALSE}
0myvar <- F
_myvar <- F
my var <- F
```

### <!-- empty subheader to separate the next part -->

For more information about object names in \R{}, see:

- [Section 1.8](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#R-commands_003b-case-sensitivity-etc) of 
  ['An Introduction to R'](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)
  
- [Section 2.1.3](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html#Language-objects) of
  ['The R Language Definition'](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-lang.html)



## Object Names: Hidden

- Names starting with a period (`.`) are special and normally hidden from users.

```{r, results='hide'}
ls()
ls(all.names = TRUE)
```

  - Names starting with a period are used by packages or the system for special objects that users should not interact with directly.
  - Such objects may not behave as expected with common commands, such as `ls()` (above).
  - Therefore, most users should avoid doing this unless they know what they are doing and have a good reason to do so.


## Object Names: Advanced

- 'Valid' names following the rules above can be referred to easily in code.

- Names with any character are actually possible, but must be quoted with backticks (`` ` ``{.r})
  - **This is not recommended practice**, but occasionally useful when you need to refer to an element of an object, such as list items or data frame columns, that have non-standard names.

```{r}
`(my) [strange] {variable} 'name' "!@#$"` <- T
print(`(my) [strange] {variable} 'name' "!@#$"`)
```


# Special Operators

## Matrix math

- $\R$ can do _matrix math_ --- which is used in many statistical procedures

  - But the _syntax_ is different from the usual math operators

- Using a regular multiplication symbol (`*`) results in *element*-wise multiplication

  - each _element_ (item) in matrix1 is multiplied by the corresponding _element_ in matrix2, etc.

```{r results='hide'}
c(1, 2, 3) * c(3, 2, 1)
```
- _Matrix multiplication_ is specified by this operator: `%*%`{.r}

```{r results='hide'}
c(1, 2, 3) %*% c(3, 2, 1)
```
